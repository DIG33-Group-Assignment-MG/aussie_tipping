<h1>API Test Page</h1>

<p>I would like to use this page to start building the logic for our site. </p>

<p>There will be not real styling to start with as I am still just getting a handle on the information side of things</p>

<p>I will start building navbar items so you can start seeing responses as I build them. Think of it as our own Docs</p>
